## Business Requirements

- BR1: We want a website that displays a video to the trainee with interactions inside the video. This is a business requirement because the client wants the trainee to have multiple calls within a video. This will better the flow of the training, because the calls will be related to each other.
- BR2: We want a video encoder that can add timestamps to the video to allow the lesson designer to decide where the call is. This is a business requirement because the client wants to have control where the video stops, and this will help them automate the process of creating lessons for their trainees.
- BR3: We want to be able to create an activity when the timestamp ends that will allow us to create dynamic problems and answers. This is a business requirement because this will increase the variety of training the client/website can provide.
- BR4: We want to implement an eye tracking system that will track where a user is watching the video to verify that the user is looking at the correct spot in the lesson. This is a business requirement because this system will offer a competitive measurement of engagement with the user in a way that other trainee systems do not.
