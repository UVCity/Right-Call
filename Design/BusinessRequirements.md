# Business Requirements

- ## BR1: We want to increase the efficiency of lessons being displayed to the trainees.
    This is a business requirement because it describes one of the client's overall goals for the system. The client wants a video editor that has multiple timestamps each with an activity in a video. This will better the flow of the training, because the calls will be related to each other. The client also wants a video encoder that can add timestamps to the video to allow the lesson designer to decide where the call is, and we feel that this covers these goals.
- ## BR2: We want to improve the accuracy of the feedback to the user based on their eye-tracking data.
    This is a business requirement because it describes the second overall goal of the software: the eye-tracking and feedback of the user. The client wants the system to be able to create an activity when the timestamp ends that will allow us to create dynamic problems and answers. Through the use of eye-tracking software, we will be able to verify that the user is looking at the correct spot in the lesson. This will allow us to provide more accurate feedback and results to each of the user's answers. We feel that this business requirement covers these goals.
