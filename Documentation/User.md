- If the admin selects the Upload Lesson Video link, the admin will be redirected to the upload video page. 
- To upload a video, the user would click on the select video button, and then they would select a video file from their computer.
- For the video input, there are three supported types of videos that can be uploaded: MP4, WebM, and Ogg.
- Once selected, they would then click upload and if it works, it would direct them back to the admin page and a lesson would succesfully be created.
- A message will appear to let the admin know the video is still uploading.
- The video may take a little bit (around 10 seconds) to upload, so don't click upload again or anything else until redirected back to the admin page. 


## Deleting Videos/Lessons
