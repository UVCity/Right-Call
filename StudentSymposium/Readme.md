## Individual Experiences



Bradley
- I enjoyed going to the other Capstone teams and discovering how thier projects have come along. It felt nice to see teams that were invested in making great projects. I also enjoyed talking about our project and spreading the word about our great work.

Jeremiah
- I enjoyed my time at the symposium. I really liked seeing all of the other projects around us, and seeing how advanced some of the projects were. It was nice to talk about our project to people who were interested to learn about it. Overall, it was a good experience and I am glad I took part in it.
