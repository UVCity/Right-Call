## Topics Discussed
Showed Duncan our project, gave us advice to get calibration of webcam done now to see if any unforeseen obstacles occur after (drifting, accuracy issues, etc.)

 - Talked about test issues, keeping tasks in order

 - Architecture
  - Bradley asked about issues related to node in mongo and the domain being related to the database, Duncan gave good advice on how this can be a frustrating issue with how our software is laid out, but Bradley was on the right track with his work on this. Although it might seem like there is an extra layer of abstraction, it still creates good data separation.
  - Moving the data base from the API directories to a data directories

 - WebGazer
  - quadrates for a new eye tracking Question type
  - Calibrations
   - Where would calibration take place
   - How often would a user have to calibrate ?

 - New Question Types


## Things Clarified
 - We have to plan for people camera conditions or if they'll even have a camera
 - with eye tracking , if a user got a question wrong , the quadrant should tell the user where they should have been looking
 - Good work with error problems and getting first stages of eye tracking implemented
