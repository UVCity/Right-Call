## Topics Discussed

- We discussed the results of our first iteration.
- Talked about making sure we had functionality for our client, and how to ensure the next iteration as easier to validate functionality
- Showed our documentaiton for the first iteration. We recieved compliments on our organization and throughness
- Worked on tricky testing bug, learned how to use the debugger

## Things Clarified

- We discussed the libraries we will likely need for the api/state management. It looks like Pinipia is the Vue recommened one
- Keep the VR expectations low, because it will be tricky. We will likely not attempt it until next semester
- Our documentation has been great so far, and we should use what we have, as a standard.
