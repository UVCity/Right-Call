## Topics Discussed
- showed off our new UI
- walked through the new system for Instructors creating their own version of a lesson to assign to their students
- showed the new Drag and Drop question type 
- showed plans for a timer on each question to track data on how long users take to answer questions
- discussed how to store Instructor's versions of the lessons

## Things Clarified
- creating a copy of the admin lesson within the db and copying it over to an Instructor Lessons folder, and identifying each lesson with the unique Instructor ID from the Instructor who created it seems to be the most reasonable method for storing these unique Instructor lessons.
- doing it this way also lets us avoid reuploading a videoclip to AWS more than once, which will keep the video storage at a minimum
- getting data related to types of questions Instructors are focusing on within certain areas could be very valuable to RefReps.

## Feedback 
- UI changes are great. The site has a consistent style that works well.
- Drag and Drop setup is nice and open-ended, allowing for new/different features to be added within.
- gathering different types of data related to the quizzes could be very valuable
