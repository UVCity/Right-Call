## Topics Discussed
 
 - semi transparent overlay styling to indicate that their are quadrants where they should be looking to help lead a user to answering the question

 - after creating a lesson , the instructor should be sent to the update lesson instead of going to instructor home page

 - we should allow dynamic editing the time of a timestamp question rather than having to delete it

 - We should change the icon of a Activity when hovering over them in the edit lesson page
  - show a eye for eye tracking questions
  - think of icons for Multi-Choice Questions

 - test user experience with & without the red dot


## Things Clarified
 - WebGazer would not work correctly via AWS DOCKER, because it only works on HTTPS servers


## Client Use of the Project

### How did the client use the software?
 - The client used a HTTP site hosted from AWS Docker 

### What features did they test in your software?
 - We had the client use the application as an student
  - The client had tested an eye tracking question ( without the webcam ), a multiple choice question, and a Drag N Drop Question
 - We had the client use the application as an instructor
  - The client had set up an eye tracking question, a multiple choice question, and a Drag N Drop Question


### How long did they use your software?
 - The client used the application for about a total of 20 minutes

### How was their reaction to the software?
 - "I like this a lot! The application feels very smooth."
 - he liked the click and drag questions 
 - he says that he really liked what we have put together within the months we have been working together

 - our current ability for them to customize feedback for lesson questions is very helpful
  - client mentioned that question-answers feedback could be optional 

### Did you recognize anything unusual/different/good/bad?
 - Client noticed that each time adding a student to a lesson , the tab closes out 
  - Add or remove multiple students to classes
  - Similarly add or remove multiple lessons 

 - Client noticed that the eye tracking question was set-up to be answered almost immediately 
  - We don't want to record the users eye tracking response so quick that it doesn't give the user a chance to answer the question correctly
  - There should be a timer ( or some notification to the user to look in the correct area ) and give the user time to adjust from reading the prompt to then directing their attention to what they believe to be the correct quadrant

### Issues (any usability, functionality, etc. issues)
 - Other than WebGazer only being compatible with HTTPS Servers , there were no software issues during the presentation.
