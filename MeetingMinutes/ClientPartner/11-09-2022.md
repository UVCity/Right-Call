# Topics Discussed
Today we discussed our current iteration and then discussed ideas going forth to the next iteration.
 - Login page
 - A possible Admin user who is capable of adding videos to the database
 - A Teacher User who is able edit & create a right-call lesson
    - demo videos
    - true or false
    - multiple choice
    - pop-up questions
    - a drag and drop system
    - once the Teacher saves this lesson, a Trainee can then see those changes.
 - Saving the right/wrong answers to a database
 - We expressed that this second iteration our main focus is backend development & working with a database.
 - separate a Teaching User from a Trainee User

# Things Clarified
 - eye tracking implementation will not be in this iteration.
 - going through the whole process of creating a login system
 - after making a call the training video should continue
