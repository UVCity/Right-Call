# Topics Discussed

What would we like to see for iteration 3
 + look into another question type
 + grouping students with instructors
 + dynamic manipulation of Course objects , which will be grouped lesson objects

 + we could play around with eye tracking
- - EXAMPLE : at 15 sec check to see if the viewer is looking in the correct place


# Things Clarified

- Admins create courses & lessons , and can modify them both
- Instructors edit the lesson ( timestamps )
- Trainee results need to be saved & at the end of a lesson
