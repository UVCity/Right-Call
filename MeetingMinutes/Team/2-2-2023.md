Luke

## Topics Discussed
- Bradley is focusing on writing backend tests. Once he successfully finishes the first page of tests, the rest should be able to be copy/pasted to match that layout, making them very easy and straightforward to test.
- The most prevalent issue remaining is styling. Some pages have little to none, and should be updated to match the look of the rest of the site.
- Eye tracking questions will be finished and implemented in the next few days.

## Things Clarified
- The last few days of the iteration will be focused on fixing tests and styling. The goal is to exceed the 70% code coverage for tests, and to have all pages at least decently styled.
- The last few features should be finished by the weekend. Once those are finished, it is full steam ahead on testing and styling.
