## Topics Discussed
- progress on modal pop-up, looked at resources on how to implement pop-up within our app.
- progess on testing, the testing of rendered components is going well, more time is needed to properly 
  implement testing the methods within each component.
- group walkthrough of Docker and Docker Desktop, working on getting things running properly for 
  everyone.
- plans for the next week: finish up implementation of modal pop-up, set up sample questions to be 
  displayed in pop-up while API is still on backburner, get Docker properly set up for development.

## Things Clarified
Tasks are split up so everyone has something important to complete this week, some working in pairs to finish high priority tasks faster.
