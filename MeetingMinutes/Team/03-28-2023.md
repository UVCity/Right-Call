## Topics Discussed
- Changes to allow Instructors to add more than one student/video to lesson
- Ideas for Question Type icons
- Change how renaming lessons/videos works

## Things Clarified
- Right now a user can only rename an entire lesson. This option is available on both the page listing all videos inside the lesson and within the AssignTimestamps instance of editing that video. This is misleading, because it seems like you are renaming the video, when you are changing it's parent lesson's name. This should be changed or removed to avoid confusion.

## Tasks Distributed
- Luke is working on new Question Type icons and an option to view an activity's content by hoverign over the icon.
- Jeremiah is working on tests and allowing the instructors to add more than one student/video to a lesson.
- Josh is working on storing the User's best result/
- Bradley is working on back end tests and storing question Timer data
