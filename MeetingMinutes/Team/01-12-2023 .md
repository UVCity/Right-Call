## Topics Discussed
Distribution of tasks  
Brainstorming possible question types, and creating a list to ask our client  
How we can continue looking for more possible novel solutions to our clients problems.

## Things Clarified
We reiterated our prioritization of eye tracking this iteration. We talked about possible issues with the libraries and how we can overcome them. Also we addressed how we can write questions that are accessible to people who do not have thier cameras on. Once Luke is done with his creation of the new question types he will work on connecting them with eyetracking when it is appropriate.

Bradley will work on refactioring the api to decouple the api from the data layer. This was a big roadblock last semester, so it needs to be addressed early on.

As we keep communicating with our client frequently, we need to start asking whether they have their stories done on another platform. This will allow us to focus on things that are new to them, and we can find ways around redoing a lof the work they already have done.
